WickeyAppStore apps use SSO (single sign on) for security and ease of use.    When you login it will email you a 6 digit token, which you then verify in the app.        Then, all other WickeyAppStore apps will *auto-magically be logged in.        *This only works on the same physical device    **Deleting cookies will log you out        v{{version}}            Okay    Login  '\n    var COMPONENTS = [{'name': 'WasAlert', 'selector': ''},{'name': 'WasLeaderboard', 'selector': ''},{'name': 'WasPay', 'selector': ''},{'name': 'WasProfile', 'selector': ''},{'name': 'WasReview', 'selector': ''},{'name': 'WasShop', 'selector': ''},{'name': 'WasSSO', 'selector': ''},{'name': 'WasUp', 'selector': ''},{'name': 'WickeyAppStoreComponent', 'selector': 'wickey-appstore'}];\n    var DIRECTIVES = [];\n    var ACTUAL_COMPONENT = {'name': 'WasProfile'};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"components/WasReview.html":{"url":"components/WasReview.html","title":"component - WasReview","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n  Components\n  WasReview\n\n\n\n        \n            Info\n        \n        \n            Template\n        \n        \n            Styles\n        \n        \n            DOM Tree\n        \n\n\n\n    \n    File\n\n\n    projects/wickeyappstore/src/lib/ui/popover/wasreview/wasreview.dialog.ts\n\n\n    \n        Description\n    \n    \n        Leave an app review with WasReview\n * import { WasReview } from 'wickeyappstore';\n * import { MatDialog, MatDialogRef } from '@angular/material';\n * ...\n * constructor(public dialog: MatDialog) { } // and Inject MatDialog in the constructor\n * ...\n * this.dialog.open(WasReview);\n *\n    \n\n\n    \n        Implements\n    \n    \n                OnDestroy\n    \n\n\n\n    Metadata\n    \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            \n                styleUrls\n                ../was.component.css\n            \n\n\n\n            \n                templateUrl\n                ./wasreview.dialog.html\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n  \n    \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n    \n  \n  Add a review\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n      star_border\n      \n      0\">star\n    \n    \n      star_border\n      1\">star\n    \n    \n      star_border\n      2\">star\n    \n    \n      star_border\n      3\">star\n    \n    \n      star_border\n      4\">star\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n    \n    \n      \n    \n  \n\n\n  Cancel\n  Send\n\n    \n\n    \n                \n                    ../was.component.css\n                \n                .wasup-title {\n    text-align: center;\n    font-size: 1.4em;\n    color: #5b5b65;\n    /* text-shadow: 0 1px 0 #fff;

A PWA makes use of new Web and JavaScript API to deliver an experience similar to a native app on the web. Reach the next One Billion users with lightweight, platform independant, full featured, web-apps.\nApps on the WickeyAppStore must meet quality and security requirements:\n\nSafety - must be served via HTTPS to ensure that the real content has not been tampered.\nResponsive - can fit all resolutions like desktop, tablet and mobile.\nProgressive- work in all modern browsers because they use progressive enhancement concepts.\nConnectivity independent - need to work on any type of connection, including offline.\nEngageable - using push notifications, \"add to home\" feature to be more app-like.\n\nBenefits\n\nTrust - each app is vetted and approved manually.  Only high quality apps are featured on the WickeyAppStore.\nSingle Sign On - you do not need to sign into apps you do not know or trust. Your WickeyAppStore SSO is all you need.\nMonetization - we provide monetization tools including in-app purchases and ads.\nTraffic - we feature unique and cool apps, and all apps benefit from being under one umbrella.\n\nSubmit your app\nCreate your app in the dev portal and use it to add meta data, in-app purchases, and so on.\nHere's a link to get started: Developer Portal\nQuickStart (Angular)\nPrerequisite: nodejs needs to be installed on your pc.\nClone our starter project Airhorn.\nWhere mywasapp is the name of your app, replace with whatever is desired.\ngit clone https://github.com/wickeyware/was-tutorial.git mywasappChange to that directory\ncd mywasapp/Install project dependencies and run.\nwith npm.\nNOTE: npm will already be installed if node is already installed.\nnpm install\nnpm run build:lib\nnpm run startwith yarn\nyarn\nyarn run build:lib\nyarn run startNow visit localhost:4204\nTo build your app in preparation for deployment to the WickeyAppStore.\nnpm run buildyarn run buildThe output dist/ directory is what will be selected to deploy on: developer.wickeyappstore.com\nQuickStart (Manual Angular Integration)\nTo install this library, run: (NOTE: Install all dependencies)\nnpm install wickeyappstore --saveImport Material theme in global styles.css\n@import \"~@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/indigo-pink.css\";and then from your Angular AppModule:\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\n// Import Wickey AppStore\nimport { WickeyAppStoreModule } from 'wickeyappstore';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    RouterModule,\n    FormsModule,\n    // Specify as an import\n    WickeyAppStoreModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule { }Once WickeyAppStoreModule is imported, you can use its components, directives and pipes in your Angular application:\n\n\n\n\n\n  Welcome to my app!\nQuickStart Other (JS)\nExample index.html:\nNOTE: Make sure to add the dependencies to the header, then add the tag  and the wickeyappstore.js script in the body.\n\n\n\n  \n  Custom WAS Test Page\n  \n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\n\n  \n  \n  \n    const wickeyappstore = document.querySelector('wickey-appstore');\n    wickeyappstore.addEventListener('open', (event) => {\n      console.log('WAS button opened');
